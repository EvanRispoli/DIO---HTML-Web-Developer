                <p class="descricao">
                    Frank Underwood, a power-hungry Democratic congressman from South Carolina 
                    and House majority whip, celebrates the 2012 election of President Garrett 
                    Walker, who had agreed to appoint him Secretary of State. However, Underwood 
                    learns that the President wants him to promote his agenda in Congress and will
                     not honor their agreement. Inwardly seething, Underwood presents himself as a 
                     helpful lieutenant to Walker. In reality, Underwood begins an elaborate plan 
                     behind the President's back. Frank's wife Claire runs an NGO, the Clean Water 
                     Initiative, which she uses to cultivate her own power; she seeks to expand its 
                     scope to the international stage, often using Frank's connections. Claire shares 
                     her husband's cold-hearted, ruthless pragmatism and lust for power, and they 
                     frequently scheme together to ensure the success of each other's ventures. 
                     They both work with Remy Danton, a corporate lobbyist and former Underwood 
                     staffer, to secure funds for their operations and expand their influence.
